## Overview
To convert text data into an image and retrieving the same data from an image...



## Description
the main goal of this project is to encode text in image file and decode the image file in text file without any loss in data ...<br>
`txt` --> `image` Â && `image` --> `txt`

## Process
Text file contains of data in form of word, this Words are made up of letter. Each letter occupied some byte of memory. Each letter has a unique ASCII value. ASCII is an 8-bit code. That is, it uses eight bits to represent a letter.

So for each letter there is an ASCII value and each ASCII value is 8 bit.

Now image is made up of pixels and every bit data is represented in `0` or `1`
If we represent `0` as `WHITE` and `1` as `BLACK`

So we can fill each pixel with `BLACK` or `WHITE`
So 8 Pixel will correspond to a ASCII number will will lead to a letter.
